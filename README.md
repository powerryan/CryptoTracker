Vision statement: Provide an elegant and customizable dashboard optimized for viewing real-time price action of leading cryptocurrencies to empower our users to make informed trading decisions.

Motivation: Our motivation behind the Crypto Tracker was to provide users with a tool to monitor the past performance
and leading indicators for a select set of cryptocurrency, including basic visualizations. Cryptocurrencies are very new
markets and we saw an opportunity to help consumers consolidate information for ease of use.

Risks to project completion:
New languages and frameworks. The majority of our team have not had much experience developing web applications or using the related languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). Also, the working environment will be remote which will make collaboration and communication more difficult.

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
To address the first issue of new languages and frameworks we will start working early to allow ourselves plenty of time to learn. We will also design the project in a way that keeps the programming as simple as possible. More complex features and functions can be added later if there is time and the need.
To address the issue of working environment we will schedule weekly standups to discuss the project and start a group chat (text message or similar) so that issues and communication can be addressed quickly.


Development method: We have opted to apply agile (scrum) development process and ceremonies, as this will help us manage
this project with greater flexibility. Our goal being to implement a base set of features, but based on our ability to execute,
provide an opportunity to scope in additional features if time allows. We use a weekly sprint duration, meeting tuesday evenings at 7pm MST
for our stand up and sprint planning.

Project Tracking Software: Trello - we need a simple board to manage our stories
